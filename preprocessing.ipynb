      "Text: Despite the clinically recognized association between endometriosis and infertility, the mechanisms implicated in endometriosisassociated infertility are not fully understood. Endometriosis is a multifactorial and systemic disease that has pleiotropic direct and indirect effects on reproduction. A complex interaction between endometriosis subtype, pain, in  ammation, altered pelvic anatomy, adhesions, disrupted ovarian reservefunction, and compromised endometrial receptivity as well as systemic effects of the disease de  ne endometriosisassociated infertility. The population of infertile women with endometriosis is heterogeneous, and diverse patients  phenotypes can be observed in the clinical setting, thus making dif  cult to establish a precise diagnosis and a single mechanism of endometriosis related infertility. Moreover, clinical management of infertility associated with endometriosis can be challenging due to this heterogeneity. Innovative noninvasive diagnostic tools are on the horizon that may allow us to target the speci  c dysfunctional alteration in the reproduction process. Currently the treatment should be individualized according to the clinical situation and to the suspected level of impairment. Here we review the etiology of endometriosis related infertility as well as current treatment options, including the roles of surgery and assisted reproductive technologies.\n",

      "Text: 10 . Viable endometrial tissue moves into the pelvic cavity through the fallopian tubes at the time of menses, adheres to the peritoneal mesothelial cells, proliferates, and  nally invades pelvic structures. Retrograde menstruation is a physiological event that occurs in approximately 90 of women  11  13 . Viable endometrial tissue has been identi  ed in the shed menstrual endometrium  13 . However, the differences in its morphohistological, hormonal, and biological composition compared with the eutopic endometrium of healthy women still remain matter of investigation. Endometrial re  ux seems to be enhanced in women with endometriosis and possibly driven by the action of prostaglandins that may cause disorganized myometrial contraction  14  16 . Moreover, the incidence of endometrial re  ux is much higher in women with congenital anomalies causing menstrual out  ow obstruction  17 . This theory has been well supported by animal models of endometriosis. Normal endometrial tissue placed into the peritoneal cavity recapitulates the disease, including the effects on eutopic endometrium, suggesting that an abnormal endometrium is not a prerequisite for initiation and development of endometriosis  18  21 . Early age at menarche, long duration and heavy menstrual  ow are all wellrecognized epidemiological risk factors for the development of endometriosis. The anatomical predominance of endometriosis in the right side of both hemipelvis and diaphragm, further supports this theory  22 . This asymmetry has been attributed to both a physiological process the clockwise intraperitoneal current and an anatomical factor the presence of the sigmoid colon and falciform ligament. However, the retrograde menstruation hypothesis is not suf  cient to explain the development of rare forms of the disease.\n",
      "Text: A possible relationship between endometriosis and infertility was  rst suggested in the Corpus Hippocraticum , as women suffering from dysmenorrhea were urged to conceive as quickly as possible to increase the chance of become pregnant  2 . Today, nearly 10 of women in their reproductive age suffer from endometriosis and about one third of them experience infertility, almost twice the rate observed among women without the disease  3 . Up to 50 of infertile women are found to suffer from endometriosis  4 . Despite the clinically recognized association between endometriosis and infertility, the mechanisms implicated in endometriosisassociated infertility are unclear and this condition is currently considered multifactorial. In addition, the diagnosis of endometriosis is currently underestimated due to the almost exclusive reliance on surgical  ndings, which delays diagnosis until symptoms require surgical intervention. The ability to identify endometriosis also critically depend on surgeon  s expertise and may preclude early recognition and treatment. The average time to diagnostics ranges from 4 to 11 years is reported in these patients, and this delay has a signi  cant impact on healthcare utilization and costs  5 , 6 . Indeed, the absence of macroscopic lesions or clinical features does not exclude the diagnosis of endometriosis, as infertility is often the only health concern. Furthermore, only onehalf of women with endometriosisassociated infertility show typical lesions  7 . In women with infertility, an early diagnosis of endometriosis is crucial from the perspective of fertility because the burden of the disease could be even more deleterious when compounded by the effect of increasing age on ovarian reserve. The focus of this review is to provide an update of pathophysiology of endometriosisassociated infertility. We will also discuss current medical and surgical strategies, and the role of fertility preservation and of assisted reproductive technologies ART in patients with endometriosis.\n",

      "Text: Pathogenesis of endometriosis\n",
      "Text: The coelomic metaplasia and mullerian remnants hypothesis are both based on the concept that endometriotic lesions originate insitu from embryological remnants or by metaplasia. Based on the mullerian remnants hypothesis   mullerianosis    23 , endometriosis is a consequence of the aberrant migration and differentiation of embryonic cell rests originating from the Mullerian ducts during organogenesis. This hypothesis can explain the presence of endometriosis in in adolescents before or shortly after menarche and in fetuses  24  26 . Embryological studies  24  support the presence of Mullerian remnants in the culdesac area, uterosacral ligaments, and medial broad ligaments. Alternatively, both germinal ovarian epithelium and peritoneum may undergo a Mullerian metaplasia and differentiate into endometrium  27 . This latter theory would explain the presence of endometriosis in ovary, sigmoid colon, appendix, or more distal sites such as the diaphragm and pleura  28 , although direct in  ltration through\n",

To date, none of the proposed theories have been able to comprehensively explain the natural history of the disease and its associated diverse clinical presentations.

      "Text: that multiple genes contribute to endometriosis is widely accepted. Studies on monozygotic twins show that endometriosis has an estimated total heritability of approximately 51  58  60 . Daughters of mothers with surgically con  rmed endometriosis have more than double risk of developing the disease  61 . Moreover, familial inherited of endometriosis tends to be more severe with an earlier onset of symptoms compared with sporadic cases  55 , 62 . Metaanalyses of genomewide association studies of diverse populations have identi  ed a robust association of endometriosis with certain risk loci involved in sex steroid hormone pathways, indicating a possible role in the development of advanced stages of endometriosis  63  68 . However, none are common and in total these genetic variants account for only a small fraction disease risk. In general, a multitude of genetic variants with only weak individual effects care likely responsible for the increased hereditary risk of endometriosis  69 . In the context of infertility associated with endometriosis, a recent crosssectional study including 213 infertile women with endometriosis who underwent IVF procedures, found that single nucleotide variants of FSHB and FSHR separately interfered with the hormonal pro  le both FSH and LH levels and ultimately with the number of oocytes retrieved in these patients at any stage of the disease  70 .\n",
      "Text:  42 , 43 . Both progenitor cells within the endometrium and multipotent cells from bone marrow contribute to endometrial homeostasis. The BMDSCs travel through the circulatory system and contribute to the composition of eutopic endometrium  41 . After travelling to endometrium these BMDSCs can become restricted to an endometrial cell lineage, contributing to the pool of both stromal and epithelial endometrial progenitor cells. Some become located in the basal layer of the eutopic endometrium and regenerate on a monthly basis under the in  uence of estrogens. Furthermore, women with endometriosis have a higher number of these pluripotential cells compared with healthy women during menses  44 . During menstruation, women with endometriosis shed more basalis cells, including progenitor cells, than healthy individuals, these cells can more easily generate endometrium in ectopic locations than differentiated cells and further expand on Sampson  s theory of retrograde menstruation  45 . BMDSCs can directly differentiate into endometrium without  rst being localized in the uterus. Ectopic differentiation of circulating stem cells has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism of endometriosis. Mesenchymal extrauterine stem cells derived from bone marrow and other sources may also be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease both in the peritoneal cavity as well as distant sites. Their inappropriate differentiation to endometrial cells at ectopic locations is likely the principal source of extraperitoneal endometriosis  46 , 47 . The ability of BMDSCs to contribute to endometriotic lesion and differentiate into endometrial phenotypes help to explain how ectopic tissue can occur in locations outside the peritoneal cavity and in nonperitonealderived cells, such as lungs  48  50 , central nervous system  51  and in men  33  36 . Furthermore, BMDSC are attracted by eutopic endometrium under injury and in  ammatory conditions  52 . Endometriotic lesions, through the production and release of proin  ammatory cytokines and chemokines  47  and under estrogenic in  uence  53  recruit more stem cells to further promote lesion growth. Additionally circulating endothelial progenitor cells contribute to the vascularization of endometriotic lesions. Stem cells are also capable of traf  cking between endometriotic lesions and the eutopic endometrium, and therefore likely contribute to the impaired uterine receptivity in these women  54 . These cells, derived from endometriosis, migrate as mesenchymal stem cells MSC, engraft the uterine stroma, however activation epithelial Wnt signaling that likely distorts the epithelialstromal dialog needed for optimal endometrial development and receptivity.\n",
      "Text: The epigenetic theory\n",
      "Text: There is a growing body of evidence that epigenetics has a key role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Epigenetic modi  cations involve dynamic and reversible changes in the chromatin structure in  uencing gene expression in a heritable fashion. Epigenetic phenomena are likely to have implications for diagnosis, prognosis and for the possibility of developing targeted therapeutic strategies. The hallmarks of epigenetic gene regulation are DNA methylation hypo and hypermethylation, histone modi  cations, and microRNA production, which lead to expression or suppression of speci  c proteins. Comparative studies of both ectopic lesions and eutopic endometrium stromal cells have provided data on the role of epigenetic factors in the etiopathogenesis of endometriosis and its related infertility  19 , 71  73 . DNA methylation is one of the most common epigenetic modi  cations and active in endometrium. Numerous studies have revealed a direct correlation with the expression of genes in  uencing the implantation process in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Homebox proteinA10 HOXA10 is a gene that has a well characterized and essential role in generating a receptive endometrium. Hypermethylation of the HOXA gene promoter has been demonstrated both in animals and in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis compared to healthy controls  19 , 74 , 75 .

Moreover, miRNA signatures in endometrium are likely to change with the respect of the different phases of the menstrual cycle  99 , 100 . The most frequently detected miRNA both in endometriomas and endometriotic lesions, found to be downregulated in six studies was miR200 family, known to play a crucial role in the EMT, a relevant process in the establishment of endometriotic lesions  101 , 102 . Other miRNA reported to be differentially regulated up or downregulated in endometriotic lesions in more than two studies were miR1, 29c, 34c, 100, 141, 145, 183, 196b, 200a, 200b, 200c, 202, 365, and 375  103 . Several of these are also known to be involved in EMT, as well as, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, invasion and angiogenesis and demonstrating binding to target mRNAs is an important step to validate their role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Extracellular miRNAs are found in all body  uids, including the circulation both serum and plasma  104 . Circulating microRNAs can potentially impact endometriotic lesion development by mediating intercellular communication between eutopic endometrium and ectopic implants  105 .\n",
      "Text: hypermethylation is generally associated with gene silencing, the reduced HOXA10 gene expression in the endometrium of women with endometriosis is, at least in part, responsible for the impaired uterine receptivity. Conversely, one recent study  76  found hypomethylation of the HOXA10 gene in the endometrium of women with a previous history of endometriosis and under hormonal treatment at the time of surgery, opening the possibility that longterm therapy may reverse epigenetic signatures classically seen in the disease. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have also been found in endometriotic tissue compared with eutopic endometrium. The promoter of progesterone receptor PR isoform B gene is hypermethylated in endometriosis, with subsequent reduced PRB expression  77  79  contributing to the relatively persistent progesterone resistance. Similarly, the different level of expression and methylation hypo or hyper of certain transcriptional factors GATA6, GATA 2 and steroidogenic factor 1SF1 may account for estrogen dependency and progesterone resistance by changing the expression of both estrogen receptorbeta and progesterone receptor  80  82 . Lastly, the invasive proprieties of endometriotic cells have also found to be regulated by hypermethylation in endometriosis  83  85 . Let7 microRNA is hypermethylated in endometriosis leading to decreased Let7 expression and disinhibition of KRAS and other genes that drive endometriosis growth and invasion  86 . Little is known about the role of histone modi  cations in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, and results are often con  icting. A marked histone hypoacetylation has been shown in endometriotic stromal cells of both eutopic and ectopic tissue of affected women compared to healthy endometrium  87  and HDAC enzymes seems to play a key role in this process  88  91 . Also, acetylation levels of H3 and H4 histones are lower in ectopic lesions and eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis compared with healthy women  92 , 93 . MicroRNAs MiRNAs are small RNA molecules of approximately 22 bases. They interact with mRNA and change gene expression by inhibiting translation or inducing mRNA degradation. Their increased expression causes repression of translation from the mRNA while decreased MiRNA expression can lead to upregulation of protein production from mRNA. They also target and regulate both methylation and acetylation processes, thereby modifying the epigenome. Unlike other epigenetic mechanisms, miRNAs regulate gene expression at a posttranscriptional level, and they are found both intra and extracellularly  94 . They target genes involved in hormone metabolism, cell cycle proliferation, migration, and invasion, immune in  ammatory response, epithelialmesenchymal transition EMT, apoptosis and angiogenesis  95 . Differential expression of more than 100 miRNAs has been found in paired endometriotic lesions and eutopic endometrium of women with and without endometriosis  96 , 97 . In addition, different expression pro  les were detected and reported as characteristic\n",

As with human endometriosis, animal models of endometriosis reveal an impact on fecundity in terms of impaired folliculogenesis, ovulation, fertilization, implantation or embryonic developement  106 . Nonhuman primates have been extensively used as experimental models for endometriosis because of their phylogenetic proximity to humans. They menstruate cyclically and therefore they can develop endometriosis spontaneously, resembling the human disease based on retrograde menstruation. To date, 11 species of menstruating nonhuman primates have been reported  107 . Ectopic lesions are laparoscopically and histologically identical and at a similar pelvic sites  108 . However, spontaneous endometriosis develops slowly, at a lower rate compared to humans and might be multifactorial. Therefore, alternative methods of arti  cially induced endometriosis have been introduced in these species cervical repositioning  109 , cervical occlusion  110  or surgical induction  18 , 21 .

Endometriosis is associated with a 9fold increased risk of deep dyspareunia mostly due to the in  ltrative form and severe stages of the disease affecting the posterior vaginal fornix, the pouch of Douglas, the uterosacral ligaments, and the rectum  117  119 . Although relatively frequent, dyspareunia, is not the exclusive sexual complaint in women with endometriosis. Systematic reviews have highlighted that about two thirds of women with endometriosis have some form of sexual dysfunction not limited to deep dyspareunia  120  122 . Chronic, nonmenstrual pelvic pain associated with the disease might in  uence sexual life by reducing desire, frequency of sexual intercourse, arousal, or orgasm. This will have a signi  cant negative impact on intimate relationships, emotional wellbeing, and quality of life in general. In this regard, a holistic approach, rather than just a mechanistic approach, is mandatory given the complex nature of human sexuality.\n",

These models offer the opportunity to investigate the effect of endometriosis on the eutopic endometrium because of their similar reproductive physiology and endometrial pattern compared to humans. However, high costs, restricted facilities and ethical challenges are limiting their use for experimental purposes. Conversely, rodents do not menstruate and therefore they do not develop endometriosis spontaneously. Only homologuos models of surgically induced endometriosis have been used so far in this setting. Heterologous mouse models consisting of immunode  cient mouses do not seem offer obvious advantages in the study of endometriosis associated infertility. Ectopic transplanted tissue grows and behaves in a hormone dependent manner, and they exhibit similar histological patterns compared with human endometriotic lesions  106 . Despite of these limitations, the rodent model offers a low cost option and the opportunity to perform studies on large homogeneous groups of genetically similar animals. Transgenerational and longterm studies can also be performed because there is no rejection of the transplanted ectopic tissue. For an accurate model of the human condition, an intact hypothalamic pituitaryovarian axis in the animal recipient is essential for the evaluation of endometriosis and its related infertility. Another challenge is the dif  culty in developing models that recapitulate all subtypes of endometriotic disease and therefore individualize and target. For example, there is a lack of speci  c in vivo models which resemble characteristics of ovarian endometriosis and its related infertility. To date, few animal models of ovarian endometriosis have been successfully implemented  108 , 111 , 112 . Spontaneous ovarian endometriosis in nonhuman primates is also not as common as in humans  108 . Lastly, a major limitation of these models is the concomitant establishment of other subtypes of the disease within the peritoneal cavity causing potential confounding effects. To capture the full extent of human disease it is possible to transplant human endometriosis into an immunode  cient mouse. This model may best recapitulate human disease  113 .\n",

One recent study  138  found that proteins involved in apoptotic pathways were signi  cantly increased in cortical tissue surrounding small endometriotic cysts 3cm but not in those surrounding other benign cysts. Clinical  ndings con  rm this trend one recent, large, prospective cohort study including 106,633 premenopausal, laparoscopically con  rmed endometriosis patients found higher risk for early natural menopause compared to those without endometriosis, especially in nulliparous women and in those who never used oral contraceptives  139 . In two recent metaanalysis both serum AMH and AFC were found to be reduced in patients with unoperated endometriomas compared to patients with other benign ovarian cysts without endometriosis  140 , 141 . Moreover, in a prospective longitudinal study, a timedependent effect was recently where serum AMH decline in women with untreated endometriomas faster than in agematched healthy controls  142 . Five meta analyses  143  146  evaluating reproductive outcomes of women with endometrioma who had not undergone previous adnexal surgery found a reduced responsiveness to ovarian stimulation as measured by higher cycle cancellation rate, lower number of oocytes retrieved and lower number of formed embryos despite similar pregnancy and live birth rates. Besides their overall effect, important questions have been raised concerning endometrioma and the effect of size and bilaterality. Indeed, several comparative studies  147  150  in patients with unilateral endometriomas undergoing IVF showed that the affected and the healthy ovary produce a similar number of codominant follicles and oocytes perhaps indicating more than a local effect in the affected ovary a single visible endometrioma maybe a marker of bilateral disease or alternatively there may be a systemic effect of the single endometrioma on both ovaries. Women with bilateral endometriomas demonstrate an even lower response to stimulation, however clinical pregnancy rate are not affected  151  153 , likely overcome by the availability of multiple eggs and embryos Another key concern is whether surgery has a negative impact on residual ovarian function. Despite the many studies that have been performed to evaluate the impact of surgical treatment of ovarian endometrioma on ovarian reserve, the data are still inconclusive. The potential detrimental impact of adnexal surgery on ovarian reserve has been elucidated in several histological studies con  rming that cystectomy is generally associated with inadvertent removal of healthy ovarian tissue and primordial follicles adjacent to the cyst  s pseudocapsule  154 , 155  this effect increases proportionally with cyst diameter  156 , and ultimately is poorly correlated with the level of expertise in reproductive surgery  157 , 158 . Unlike other benign cysts, in which a wellde  ned capsule is present, endometrioma is not surrounded by a capsule  154  and technical dif  culties may arise due to the absence of a clear cleavage plane.

      "Text: ovarian function. Whether the endometrioma reduces the amount of functional tissue available by spaceoccupying effect mechanical stretching damage or by a direct toxic effect remains unknown. An endometrioma is a peculiar benign cyst without a real capsule therefore, there is exchange of cysts contents with the adjacent healthy ovarian cortex. Unlikely other benign cysts, the  uid of endometriotic cyst is able to induce oxidative stress in viable cells and potentially cause damage to healthy tissue. Molecular comparative analysis of the cystic  uid revealed high concentrations of free iron which is able to mediate the production of reactive oxygen species ROS that are highly diffusible through cellular compartments. An increase in the iron concentration in the follicular  uid from follicles in contact with the endometrioma was found in comparison with the contralateral healthy ovary  127 . Moreover, proteolytic enzymes, in  ammatory and adhesion molecules were also found in the endometriotic cyst  uid microenviroment  128 . Thus, the release of toxic cysts contents in the adjacent ovarian parenchyma may lead to oxidative stress,  brosis, loss of cortical stroma, smooth muscle cell metaplasia, impaired vascularization, and, at later stage, reduced follicular maturation and atresia in early follicles  128 . Notably, the demonstration of increased oxidative stress affecting the normal ovarian cortex surrounding an endometrioma strongly suggest a ROSinduced  brogenic response, leading to inhibition of angiogenesis and to follicular damage  129 . Maneschi et al.  130   rst found a reduced follicular number and activity prior to surgery compared in histopathological specimens of endometriomas compared to other benign cysts these  ndings were later con  rmed in other similar studies evaluating follicular density  131  133 . Another histopathological study also found increased  brotic tissue surrounding endometrioma in comparison with that of other benign cysts  134 . Interestingly, focal in  ammation in the ovarian cortex of affected ovaries was suggested to cause enhanced follicular recruitment and atresia as a result of  brosis and loss of cortexspeci  c stroma that maintains the follicular niche  135 . Hence, excessive primordial follicle activation was proposed as a mechanism of  burnout  of the follicular reservoir in ovarian endometriosis  136 . Primordial follicle activation is an irreversible process and results in follicular depletion. The PI3KPTENAktFOXO3 and PI3K AktmTOR signaling pathways are the bestcharacterized regulators of primordial follicle activation during the initial recruitment. Takeuchi et al.  136  demonstrated that the number of primordial follicles was diminished, whereas primary, secondary, antral and growing follicle numbers increased in human ovaries with endometrioma, and this effect was mediated by the PI3KPTENAktFoxo3 pathway. Similarly luteinized granulosa cells of women with endometriosis are characterized by increased apoptosis  137 , however the speci  c putative mechanism leading to cell loss has not been\n",

Conversely, one recent retrospective analysis using timelapse technology observed altered relative kinetics in embryos from patients with endometriosis, supporting poorer embryo quality  176 . Lastly, from the oocyte donation perspective, reduced pregnancy and implantation rates are observed when oocytes come from donors with endometriosis  177  179 , supporting an effect of endometriosis on embryo quality. In contrast no difference was seen in recipients of donated oocytes based on the presence or absence of endometriosis. However, the cases used in these studies do not re  ect the general population of women with endometriosis. The recipients in oocyte donation programs are relatively older compared with the majority of women with endometriosis seeking for pregnancy. With diminishing ovarian reserve and menopause endometriosis typically resolves. A history of endometriosis in a recipient of donor oocytes may not re  ect current disease status. Therefore, use of results from oocyte donation does not provide a valid model to evaluate implantation and pregnancy rates in young women with infertility related to endometriosis. Dysregulation of steroidogenesis and alterations of intrafollicular microenvironment are the main pathophysiological processes investigated in the context of endometriosis. E 2 is crucial for follicular maturation and oocyte competence follicular  uid also plays an important role in the reproductive performance of oocytes. Alterations in the normal physiology of the granulosa cells such as increased apoptosis and dysregulations of molecular pathways involved in its development and have been intensively studied. Granulosa cells of women with endometriosis are characterized by a decreased expression of P540 aromatase, a key enzyme in estrogen production. Similarly, some evidence also indicates an altered progesterone secretion from granulosa cells that might affect normal oocyte maturation  180 , 181 . Symmetrical lower E 2 levels and higher progesterone levels were found in the follicular  uid of patients with endometriosis compared to controls  182 . Moreover, follicular  uid has been shown to be subject to an important oxidative stress  183  188 . An imbalance in ROS and antioxidant systems in the oocyte microenvironment could promote abnormal oocyte development, causing DNA damage, which would result in lower oocyte quality. In another study, cryopreserved human oocytes exposed to endometriotic  uid from patients with advanced stages of the disease had excess cellular fragmentation of derived embryos that may lead to impaired embryo development by inducing apoptosis in surrounding blastomeres or by altering blastomere division  189 .

In contrast, two metaanalyses showed that ovarian reserve evaluated by AFC is not decreased after surgical treatment of endometriomas  162 , 166 . Concerning reproductive outcomes following IVF treatment, two recent metaanalyses  167 , 168  showed a lower number of oocytes retrieved in women who had surgical treatment for endometrioma compared to women with expectant management this  nding was previously con  rmed separately in case of unilateral treatment, compared with the contralateral normal ovary without endometrioma in the same patient  144 .

On the other hand, higher FSH and LH levels between the 2 nd and the 5 th day of the cycle prior to IVF required higher doses of gonadotropins for ovarian stimulation, and lower number of oocytes were retrieved after surgery for endometrioma in the remaining cohort of patients addressed for IVF, compared with women with unexplained infertility. Despite all these efforts, further clinical analysis implementing standardization of endometrioma size, bilaterality, surgical technique, postoperative timeinterval evaluations and clinical measurements are needed to help in elucidating both contributions and the magnitude of the effect.\n",

Defective implantation could be due to a reduced endometrial receptivity or decidualization capacity in these women. The eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis displays several molecular and functional, abnormalities compared to healthy women  s endometrium  220  223 . Gradual and profound alterations have also been detected in the endometrium of endometriosisinduced baboons  224 , 225 . However, the mechanism and speci  c signal that leads to alterations in the endometrial microenvironment of women with endometriosis is not fully characterized and is still unknown whether changes in the endometrial pattern are the cause for the infertility and for presence of ectopic lesions or vice versa. Endometrial receptivity and decidualization is dependent upon hormonally regulated molecular processes. Estradiol E 2  and progesterone P 4  responsive signaling pathways are regulated in an epithelial and stromal compartmentspeci  c manner in the endometrium. Progesterone is the main hormone responsible for the transient receptive endometrial phenotype, essential for embryo implantation. The endometrial response to P 4 is characterized by inhibition of estrogendependent proliferation of epithelial cells, secretory maturation of the glands, and transformation of stromal cells into specialized decidual cells. Functional dysregulation of steroid hormone signaling in endometriosis, such as upregulation of E 2 induced cell proliferation, in  ammation and progesterone resistance, seems to play an important role in impairing endometrial receptivity in these patients  226 , 227 . The shift toward estrogen dominance promotes in  ammation, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and immunosuppression. Both total endometrial PR expression and PRAPRB isoforms ratios are dysregulated in the endometrium of women with endometriosis  222 , 228  230  and in mice with induced endometriosis  19 . Moreover, progesterone receptor expression levels are lower in women with endometriosis associatedinfertility  231 , whereas estrogen receptor 1 ESR 1 levels are increased in the mid secretory phase endometrium of these women compared to controls  232 , 233 . From a histological perspective, Noyes et al. in 1950 have been proposed eight morphological criteria to evaluate endometrial receptivity, and for many decades they were adopted as the main diagnostic tool for detection of endometrial receptivity defects. However, these criteria have been questioned in recent years and several randomized control trials RCT  234 , 235  have invalidated their use based on data demonstrating that histological dating of the endometrium does not discriminate between fertile and infertile women. Similarly, the negative predictive value of the endometrial thickness and the endometrial pattern as ultrasonographic parameters  236  239  in predicting endometrial receptivity are insuf  cient  240 .\n",

Three studies have shown spindle and chromosome damage after incubating murine  193 , 194  and bovine  185 , 195  oocytes in metaphase II with both peritoneal  uid and follicular  uid derived from infertile women with endometriosis. A reduced implantation rate in normal rabbits was observed when the peritoneal  uid from rabbits with surgically induced endometriosis was transferred  196 . On the other hand, intraperitoneal injection of peritoneal  uid from women with endometriosis signi  cantly reduced implantation rates in rabbits as well as in hamsters  197 , 198 . Gamete transport is also affected by the in  ammatory microenvironment, anatomical distortions and uterotubal dysperistalsis associated with endometriosis  15 . The endometriotic proin  ammatory peritoneal  uid microenvironment may also affect sperm function  199  201  by inducing sperm DNA fragmentation  201 , disrupt sperm membrane permeability or integrity  202 , reduced sperm mobility  203 , impaired spermoocyte interaction  204  and abnormal sperm acrosome reaction  205 .\n",

Prolactin levels are signi  cantly higher in women with endometriosis when compared to those of women without endometriosis. Hyperprolactinemia prevents luteinizing hormone pulsatility and interferes with hypothalamic function by blocking estrogen receptors, thus producing anovulation. Another potential cause of ovulation failure in women with endometriosis is the luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome  208 , a condition challenging to estimate in clinical settings in which the dominant follicle undergoes luteinization but fails to rupture at or to release the oocyte. Altered patterns of estrogen and progesterone secretion leading to an abnormal luteal phase may also compromise ovulation in these women  209 .

Increased activation of PI3K AKT  252  pathway and decreased NOTCH signaling  256  contributes to inactivates FOXO1, an important mediator of decidualization involved in the progesterone signaling. Moreover, AKT pathway has been shown to downregulate and upregulate ESR2 and ESR1, respectively, with the net effect of promoting estrogen dominance  257 , 258 . Lastly, IGFBP1, a downstream target gene of HOXA 10 and a marker of decidualization, is reduced in the endometrium of women with endometriosis  251 , and it is also downregulated in the eutopic endometrium of mice with induced endometriosis  19 . It is still poorly understood how the immune system contributes to and in  uences the endometrial microenvironment and the implantation window. Data is con  icting on the immune cell population of both ectopic and eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis and controls, especially regarding absolute numbers, markers, activation states and cycle dependence due to heterogeneity of studies  259 . Eutopic endometrium microenvironment of women with endometriosis seems to be more proin  ammatory than controls and aberrant functions of certain immune population may lead to an inhospitable environment for embryo implantation. Interestingly, type I classically activated macrophages, that secretes proin  ammatory factors, are the main population in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis, across all cycle phases, compared with normal controls  260  262 . This proin  ammatory predominance may decrease embryo nidation. The relative less cytotoxicity of natural killers together with their higher immaturity in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis was signi  cantly correlated with the infertility status in the same group  263 . Concerning the role of B cells, antiendometrial antibodies may also play a role in impaired implantation by affecting directly endometrial function for embryo receptivity  264 .

Transcriptomic analysis of both eutopic and ectopic endometrium from women with or without endometriosis found dysregulations of selected genes that are implicated in the implantation process  241 . Interestingly, HOXA10 is a progesterone target in the endometrium. The homebox gene family is critical in the development of the female reproductive tract during embryonic stages as well as in the regulation of endometrial receptivity during adulthood in response to steroid hormones  242 . Decreased HOXA10 and HOXA 11 expression has shown to be involved in impaired endometrial receptivity, resulting in decreased implantation rates  75 , 243 . Patients with endometriosis do not show the normal physiologic rise in HOXA10 and HOXA11 during the midluteal phase of the menstrual cycle  75 , 243 , 244 . HOX gene expression is also subjected to epigenetic modi  cations that leads to longlasting alterations in endometrial receptivity  245 . HOXA10 hypermethylation is an important mechanism responsible for its diminished expression  74 . Both murine and baboon endometriosis models showed hypermethylation of the promoter region of HOXA10 and decreased expression of HOXA10 genes in the eutopic endometrium  19 , 246 . In humans, hypermethylation of HOXA10 was also identi  ed in the endometrium of women with endometriosis  71 , 74 . Lastly, under normal conditions, high expression of the HOXA10 gene suppresses the transcription of the EMX2 gene, which is also essential in regulating endometrial receptivity and implantation. With the diminished expression of HOXA10 in endometriosis, the increased level of endometrial EMX2 directly affects endometrial cell proliferation and function during the peri implantation period, resulting in aberrant implantation  247 . Integrins are cell adhesion molecules expressed in the endometrium during the receptive window and therefore involved in successful implantation. Interestingly, B3integrin subunit is a direct downstream target gene of both HOXA10 and ESR1  248  and its aberrant expression have been described in the endometrium of women with endometriosis. Moreover, in the clinical setting, ART is less effective in patients with lower expression level of B3integrin in the eutopic endometrium  249 . Other transcriptional factors involved in regulation and mediation of progesterone signaling IGFBP1, GATA2, FOXO1, ARID1A, NOTCH1and WNT4, required for successful implantation are also reduced in endometrium of women with endometriosis. In human endometrial stromal cells, silencing of GATA2, diminishes markers of decidualization  82  and interestingly the expression level is signi  cantly reduced in the endometrium of women with endometriosis  80 .

From the patient perspective, a shared and informed decision is mandatory because different treatment options may involve both clinical and personal aspects. The treatment must be individualized according to the clinical situation and to the suspected level of impairment. Factors such as woman  s age, ovarian reserve, duration of infertility, additional infertility factors male, tubal, ASRM stage, previous surgical treatment for endometriosis, concomitant pain, and indications for IVF ET must be considered because they will in  uence the choice of treatment and may also have socioeconomic implications. In American and European guidelines  278 , 279 , the management of endometriosis is still based on the disease stage de  ned according to the revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine rASRM classi  cation. Despite the high consensus and multiple revisions, the currently used classi  cations system has several limitations, including failure in predicting fertility outcomes and in accounting for the different types of endometriosis. For this reason, Adamson and Pasta developed a validated and predictive endometriosis staging system, the Endometriosis Fertility Index EFI, to estimate the nonART pregnancy rate natural intercourse or IUI in women with surgically documented endometriosis  280 . This scoring system, which takes into account patientrelated factors age, length of infertility, history of previous pregnancy and surgical factors rASRM total score, endometriosis lesions and  least function score  from the tubes and ovaries, is highly accurate  281  and reproducible  282  and represents an important clinical decision tool to counsel patients on their reproductive options after surgery. While ART can correct many defects that prevent conception, implantation failure is not easily identi  ed, and in most cases, there are no available treatments.

The eutopic endometrial microenviroment in adenomyosis differs from the endometrium of unaffected women  270 , 271 . However, it remains con  icting whether these changes are of clinical signi  cance and, in particular, in the setting of assisted reproductive technologies. According to the most recent metaanalysis in the  eld  213 , 272  the presence of adenomyosis was associated with lower clinical pregnancy rate, higher risk of miscarriage following ART, and independently of the mode of conception with adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. However, because of the limited number of comparative studies and their heterogeneous design, the real in  uence of adenomyosis alone on fertility is still controversial and poorly understood. One recent retrospective cohort study including more than 2000 subjects who underwent ART and by excluding those with decreased ovarian reserve and coexistence of endometriosis and  broids, found that adenomyosis has a negative effect on IVF outcomes including an increased risk of miscarriage and a reduced live birth rate  273 . There are several major limitations in investigating the impact of adenomyosis on infertility. First, there are major diagnostic limitations related with coexistence of endometriosis and adenomyosis, making the interpretation of the available literature dif  cult. Second, with the advent of 3D ultrasound and the use of magnetic resonance imaging the diagnosis of adenomyosis can now be relatively reliable without the need of histological examination of the surgical specimen  274 . However, there is no consensus regarding diagnostic features of adenomyosis using imaging making the interpretation of observational studies challenging different imaging criteria to de  ne adenomyosis are commonly used. Lastly, adenomyosis frequently coexists with other gynecological disorders and potential confounders, such as uterine leyomiomas. As with adenomyosis, uterine  broids, in particular submucous leyomiomas, has been associated with lower implantation rates and increased risk for early pregnancy loss  275 , 276 .

There are no RCT to determine whether clinical pregnancy rates are improved after surgery in patients with stage IIIIV of the disease. Women with advanced disease are normally counseled toward surgery in case of signi  cant pain symptoms, large endometriomas, or ureter and bowel clinical involvement. Apart from the deep in  ltrating endometriosis DIE induced alteration of pelvic anatomy and adhesions, evidence supporting a direct link between DIE and infertility is weak and the lack of highquality data preclude  rm conclusions on the effect of surgery. Moreover, DIE alone is found in only 6 of endometriosis patients  318  and surgeryrelated major complications in this context must be taken into account. According to three independent systematic reviews, pregnancy rate after surgery for rectovaginal endometriosis varies from 24 to 44  319  321 . An additional systematic review  322  of heterogeneous prospective and retrospective studies reported postoperative spontaneous pregnancy rates in women with DIE with and without bowel involvement of approximately 50 and 20, respectively.

The role of downregulation with GnRH agonists prior to ART has been extensively investigated and several metaanalysis have been performed however results are still contradictory. It has been proposed that medical treatment with gonadotropins prior to IVF may result in improved fertility outcomes in terms of both oocyte quality and endometrial receptivity. An updated Cochrane review by Georgiu et al.  333  that included 8 RCT concluded that the effect of longterm GnRH agonist pretreatment for at least 3 months versus no pre treatment is uncertain in terms of live birth rate primary outcome, clinical pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, mean number of oocytes and mean number of embryos.

Moreover, it is positively regulated by E2 and negatively regulated by progesterone in the mouse. It was recently found that in the eutopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis, downregulation of H19 will increase let7 activity, contributing to a decreased proliferation of endometrial stromal cells through IGFR1 expression inhibition and contributing to the impaired endometrial preparation and receptivity through reduction of stromal cell proliferation  348 . Finally, further studies have investigated the role of certain miRNA within progesterone resistance during the luteal phase in women with endometriosis they reveal that miR 30b, miR30d, miR29c and miR1943p are upregulated whereas mi494 and miR923 are down regulated in receptive endometrium  230 , 349  of both humans and baboons  350 .

The results indicate that inhibition of EP2EP4 decreases PGE 2 , estrogen biosynthesis and signaling, pro in  ammatory cytokine production, and increases P 4 signaling in eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Stem cell therapy has shown to be promising as a new therapeutic target for infertility, especially Asherman  s syndrome  353 .

Thus, skilled surgeons with expertise in reproductive pathophysiology are required to avoid potential insults to the healthy parenchyma and ovarian vascular network. Decrease of normal ovarian cortex ovarian reserve and disease recurrence are the two main risks associated with surgery for endometrioma, regardless the surgical technique. Several surgical approaches for endometrioma have been proposed Excisional, ablative or a combination of both. Lower rates of spontaneous pregnancy and higher rates of recurrence are associated with ablative surgery compared with cystectomy, whereas cystectomy was found to be deleterious for residual ovarian function  162 , 379 , 380 .
