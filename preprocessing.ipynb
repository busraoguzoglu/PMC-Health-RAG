Sampson also proposed that menstrual dis semination into the venous circulation could promote embolic disease at extrapelvic sites 35 and that ovar ian endometriomas derive from invagination of men strual debris into the ovarian cortex. 36 Over the next  100 years, several lines of experimental evidence, using animal models, human tissues, cells, and fluids and multiomic approaches, have supported retro grade menstruation, hematogenous spread, and other pathogenic mechanisms and have provided unique in sights into endometrial cell types involved in disease establishment, survival, and growth  Figure 2 4 .

Figure 5 shows an algorithm for clini cal diagnosis of endometriosis that can distinguish endome triosis from other conditions. 115 Patient and family history, symptoms, and findings on physical examination increase the likelihood of an endometriosis diagnosis. For example, the odds ratio for endometriosis diagnosis, based on only pain symptoms, increases from 5.0 to 84.7 for 1 and  7 symptoms, respectively. 118 Premenstrual spotting, irregular periods, and occasional heavy menstrual bleeding are relatively infrequent presentations. 115 Nonetheless, these are all important com ponents of historytaking in symptomatic patients and can validate the known varied symptoms experienced by those with disease and prompt investigation into other disorders. 119 However, there is a lack of awareness about endometriosis among patients and providers influenced by societal and cul tural normalization of pain in women and stigma surround ing menstrual cycles. 120 This may lead to underreporting, especially among underrepresented racial and ethnic minori ties and those of lower socioeconomic status. 121,122\n",

However, it performs poorly in detecting superficial peritoneal disease. TVUS has high accuracy, comparable to MRI, to detect deep infiltrating disease with experienced sonographers and enhancing protocols and is valuable in preoperative assessment and surgical referral. 127 A Cochrane metaanalysis found that TVUS has sensitivity and specificity similar to surgical di agnosis, depending on the type of disease. 116 A model com bining patient history, symptoms, and ultrasound predicts rASRM stages IIIIV but has not been widely adopted as it has low accuracy in predicting stage III disease. 114 A sys tematic review and metaanalysis of 30 studies involving 4,565 patients reported comparable accuracy for TVUS, transrectal TRUS, and MRI to diagnose endometriosis, and greater than physical examination alone  Table 3 . 129 It is anticipated that as more data accrue and are validated, advanced computational analyses and further predictive modeling will result in algorithms to diagnose endome triosis with high accuracy. Of course, these approaches would need to be established and validated across diverse patient cohorts.

This applies to medical therapies for endometriosisrelated pain as well as infertility. Since developing new drugs for a complex disease such as en dometriosis takes a long time and involves huge costs, there is a pressing need to consider unconventional drug development strategies and precision medicine ap proaches, such as repositioning drugs currently used for other conditions. The approach of computational drug repositioning has a number of advantages over the de velopment of new drugs and has been done successfully for various disease conditions. The development and availability of largescale genomic, transcriptomic, and other molecular profiling technologies in publicly avail able databases, in combination with the deployment of the network concept of drug targets and the power of phenotypic screening, provide an unprecedented op portunity to advance rational drug repositioning and datadriven development of drug combinations based on the ability of single or multiple therapeutic agents to perturb entire molecular networks away from disease states in cellbased and animal models. We and others have used aforementioned approaches to identify new uses for existing drugs for a number of different indica tions including inflammatory bowel disease, 164,165 can cer, 166 Alzheimers disease, 167 COVID19, 168 and most recently endometriosis. 160 Genomic and transcriptomic technologies allow us to extract large amounts of data from patient samples, elucidating previously unknown factors involved in disease, which could lead to iden tifying new therapeutic strategies. As we learn more about the complex mechanisms associated with en dometriosis and its related comorbid conditions, it is increasingly clear that treatments will likely require both precision medicine and combination therapeutic approaches.\n",

Surgery is another option for treatment in addition to diagnosis. Patient education about the disease and a dis cussion about possibly undergoing oocyte cryopreserva tion for fertility preservation is recommended, although longterm safety in adolescents with endometriosis for this procedure is unknown. 117 Moreover, the cost of oocyte cryopreservation likely would be anticipated to exclude socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Unfortu nately, endometriosis is commonly not considered among possible causes of debilitating symptoms among adoles cents because health care providers and family members and friends may not be familiar with the disorder and how to diagnose or treat it. Moreover, young women are often assumed to be somaticizing symptoms, which lengthens the path to diagnosis and treatment see Disparities sec tion below.

      "Text: 2.6.2.6  Areas for improvement The lack of clear evidence of risks and benefits, compari sons of different treatment modalities e.g., IVFIUI, and required expertise of surgeons complicates the decision to intervene with surgery. Comparisons in RCTs of surgical management among different subtypes superficial, ovarian endometriomas, and deep endometriosis, using a variety of techniques and modalities i.e., robotics, argon plasma, he lium gas, laser, etc. are also needed as well as comparisons of surgery overall to more holistic integrative options. Ad ditionally, improved preoperative biomarkers or imaging that can predict response to surgery versus medical or inte grative management, likelihood of disease recurrence, and potential effects on fertility would greatly improve clinical care and future advances in precision medicine may play a role. Unfortunately, as with most areas of clinical care im provement in surgical care for marginalized communities deserves further attention and intervention.

This indicates that there is much to study as the profile of this disease is changing and we still do not know if differences observed are related to diagnostic disparities or true variations based on ethnic groups. Furthermore, future research must include diverse populations including various ra cialethnic, transgender and gender nonconforming, and adolescent populations and consider the impact of structural racism, gender inequity, and implicit bias on study design and interpretation. Even in those with more classic symptoms of en dometriosis, diagnoses may be delayed in underserved communities. One of the most common symptoms of endometriosis, pelvic pain can be an important symptom that can lead to the diagnosis of the disease. However, historical manifestations of racism against Black people may also contribute to the disproportionate rates of endo metriosis diagnoses. Studies demonstrate that throughout history, medical institutions have furthered stereotypes that Black people are less susceptible to pain. 197 Further more, across many different types of pain experienced by patients, Black and Brown patients are often undertreated and underdiagnosed in comparison with nonHispanic white patients. 195,197 Hispanic patients who have endome triosis have identified that their dysmenorrhea and high pain are particularly severe, and negatively impact their quality of life. 198 Therefore, these implicit biases that pro viders impart to their patients and juniorlevel trainees have detrimental impacts on patient care. Thus, it is par ticularly important to understand how to address implicit biases in health care as we attempt to understand how to better attend to the needs of marginalized communi ties affected by endometriosis. If true differences do exist among racialethnic groups in the United States, further exploration into the structural, societal, and environmen tal exposures is needed in addition to evaluation of any genetic variation among ethnic groups.\n",

Recent ad vances in big data and informatics allow for integrative approaches to derive insight into diseases while taking into account the complexity and individual variability in disease via precision medicine, and thus are well posi tioned to be pursued in endometriosis research. Molecu lar profiling allows enhanced understanding of disease mechanisms at a cellular level and developing novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies. Electronic medi cal records EMR are an emerging underutilized data source with extensive longitudinal clinical information including diagnoses, medications, and labs. These data have yet to be fully utilized to study disease heteroge neity in endometriosis, with most prior studies only focusing on individual data realms e.g., clinical trials, billing, diagnosis, and even fewer studies in diverse patient populations. Both clinical and molecular data driven approaches can be applied to derive new insights and hypotheses into disease heterogeneity, particularly relevant to endometriosis. Emergence of modeling methods also provides opportunities for phenotyping and predictive modeling of disease onset on longitudi nal clinical data allowing for more precise deciphering of disease mechanisms underlying heterogeneous clini cal manifestation, as well as improvements in diagnosis. Identification of clinical features will allow the genera tion of hypotheses that can inform future studies to ver ify specific pathogenesis and phenotypes that contribute to different disease and response groups. Furthermore, implementation of predictive models on clinical data can help guide patients and clinicians to consider dis ease risk and preventative measures. By making use of rich clinical and molecular data from diverse popula tions clinicians, together with basic and computational scientists can work together to advance endometriosis research and guide clinical care through improved pa tient stratification and ultimately personalization of risk identification or treatment approaches in endometriosis enabling precision medicine for all.
